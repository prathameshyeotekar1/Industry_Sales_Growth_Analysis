An interesting observation was that for the Newspaper and Book Retailing, there was a decline in turnover starting around 2010, this decline could be due to the advancements in technology and transition to digital information. Just by observing the turnover, you can see disruption of Newspaper and Book Retailing industry.\n",

After agregating the turnover by state from 2000 to 2015, you can see that there was growth in all the states based on the linear regression line. The problem is that this growth might not be due to industry growth, but the result of the increase sales might be attributed to population growth of the states. So how can the two be differentiated?
